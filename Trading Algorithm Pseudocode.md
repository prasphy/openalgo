# Trading Algorithm for Processing TradingView Signals

This document outlines an algorithm to create an application that receives buy or sell signals from TradingView for a specific index, selects an appropriate option from the option chain based on open interest (OI), and executes trades using a broker’s API. The algorithm is designed to be modular, allowing for future enhancements.

## Inputs

- **Webhook from TradingView**: A POST request containing an alert message with:
  - Signal: "BUY" or "SELL"
  - Index symbol (e.g., "SPX" for S&P 500)
  - Optional expiration date (e.g., "2025-08-15")
- **Data Source API**: Provides current index price and option chain data (strike prices, OI for calls and puts).
- **Broker API**: Enables trade execution for buying options.

## Outputs

- **Executed Trade**: A market order to buy one contract of a call option (for buy signal) or put option (for sell signal) at the nearest strike with sufficient OI.

## Algorithm Steps

### 1. Set Up Webhook Receiver

- **Description**: Configure an HTTP server to receive POST requests from TradingView webhooks.
- **Details**:
  - TradingView webhooks send a POST request to a specified URL when an alert is triggered (TradingView Webhooks).
  - The server should have an endpoint (e.g., `/webhook`) to handle these requests.
  - Extract the alert message from the request body, which may be in JSON or plain text format.
- **Security Note**: Ensure the endpoint is secure and does not expose sensitive information, as recommended by TradingView.

### 2. Parse Alert Message

- **Description**: Extract the signal, index symbol, and expiration date from the alert message.
- **Details**:
  - Define a message format, e.g., "SIGNAL INDEX \[EXPIRATION\]" (e.g., "BUY SPX 2025-08-15" or "SELL NIFTY").
  - Parse the message to obtain:
    - **Signal**: "BUY" or "SELL"
    - **Index Symbol**: e.g., "SPX", "NIFTY"
  - If the message format is invalid, log an error and skip processing.

### 3. Get Current Index Price

- **Description**: Fetch the current price of the index using the data source API.
- **Details**:
  - Query the API with the index symbol to retrieve the latest price.
  - Example: For SPX, the API might return a price of 4500.
  - Handle API errors (e.g., connection issues) by retrying or logging a failure.

### 4. Access Option Chain

- **Description**: Retrieve the option chain for the index and expiration date.
- **Details**:
  - Use the data source API to fetch the option chain, which includes:
    - Strike prices
    - Open Interest (OI) for call and put options at each strike
  - Filter the option chain for the specified index and expiration date.
  - Example: For SPX, expiration 2025-08-15, the option chain might include strikes at 4475, 4500, 4525, etc., with corresponding OI values.

### 5. Find Nearest Strike

- **Description**: Identify the strike price closest to the current index price.
- **Details**:
  - Calculate the absolute difference between each strike price and the current index price.
  - Select the strike with the smallest difference.
  - Example: If the current price is 4500, and available strikes are 4475, 4500, 4525, select 4500.

### 6. Select Option

- **Description**: Choose the appropriate option based on the signal.
- **Details**:
  - If the signal is "BUY", select the call option for the chosen strike.
  - If the signal is "SELL", select the put option for the chosen strike.
  - Retrieve the option symbol for the selected option (e.g., "SPX 20250815C4500" for a call option).

### 7. Check Open Interest

- **Description**: Verify that the selected option has sufficient OI.
- **Details**:
  - Define a configurable OI threshold (e.g., OI ≥ 1000 contracts) to ensure liquidity.
  - Check the OI for the selected option (call for buy, put for sell).
  - If OI meets or exceeds the threshold, proceed to trade execution.
  - If OI is below the threshold, consider alternative logic:
    - Select the next closest strike with sufficient OI.
    - Or, skip the trade and log a warning.
  - For simplicity, assume the at-the-money (ATM) strike typically has sufficient OI, but verify to ensure reliability.

### 8. Execute Trade

- **Description**: Place a market order to buy one contract of the selected option.
- **Details**:
  - Use the broker’s API to create a "buy to open" order.
  - Specify:
    - Option symbol
    - Order type: Market order
    - Quantity: 1 contract
  - Example: For a buy signal on SPX, buy one call option contract at strike 4500, expiration 2025-08-15.
  - Confirm the order is placed successfully and log the order ID.

### 9. Logging and Error Handling

- **Description**: Maintain logs and handle errors to ensure robustness.
- **Details**:
  - Log each step (e.g., received signal, selected strike, executed trade) for auditing and debugging.
  - Handle errors such as:
    - Invalid alert message format
    - API failures (data source or broker)
    - Insufficient OI
    - Market hours restrictions
  - Implement retries for transient errors and notify the user of critical failures.

## Additional Considerations

- **Modularity**: Structure the algorithm with separate functions for each step (e.g., `parse_alert`, `get_index_price`, `select_option`, `execute_trade`) to facilitate future enhancements.
- **Extensibility**: Allow configuration of parameters like OI threshold, default expiration, or order quantity to support additional rules.
- **Risk Management**: Consider adding checks for:
  - Maximum position size
  - Daily loss limits
  - Market hours (only trade when options markets are open)
- **Multiple Indices**: Ensure the algorithm can handle signals for different indices (e.g., SPX, NIFTY) by using the index symbol to query the correct data.
- **Position Management**: The current algorithm focuses on entering positions. Future enhancements could include exit strategies or position monitoring.
- **Option Symbol Format**: Verify the correct option symbol format for your broker, as formats vary (e.g., OCC format for US options).

## Example Scenario

- **Input**: Webhook alert message: "BUY SPX 2025-08-15"
- **Steps**:
  1. Parse: Signal = "BUY", Index = "SPX", Expiration = "2025-08-15"
  2. Get current price: SPX price = 4500
  3. Get option chain: Strikes = \[4475, 4500, 4525\], OI for 4500 call = 1500, OI for 4500 put = 1200
  4. Select strike: 4500 (closest to 4500)
  5. Select option: Call option for strike 4500
  6. Check OI: 1500 ≥ 1000 (threshold), proceed
  7. Execute: Buy 1 contract of SPX 2025-08-15 4500 call
  8. Log: Record signal, strike, OI, and order details

## Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OI Threshold | Minimum OI for an option to be tradable | 1000 contracts |
| Default Expiration | Expiration date if not specified | Next monthly expiration |
| Order Quantity | Number of contracts to buy | 1 contract |
| Order Type | Type of order to place | Market order |

## Future Enhancements

- **Position Sizing**: Adjust order quantity based on account balance or risk parameters.
- **Advanced Strike Selection**: Consider additional criteria like implied volatility or delta.
- **Exit Strategies**: Implement rules for closing positions based on profit targets or stop-losses.
- **Multiple Signals**: Handle rapid successive signals to prevent over-trading.
- **Custom Alerts**: Allow more complex alert messages to include additional parameters (e.g., quantity, strike range).

This algorithm provides a robust foundation for automating option trades based on TradingView signals, with flexibility to incorporate additional rules as needed.
